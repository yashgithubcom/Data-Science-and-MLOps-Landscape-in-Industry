## Overview
This repository contains a detailed report analyzing the **Data Science and MLOps landscape in industry**, based on the *2022 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey*. Authored by Yash J, the project explores AI adoption, enterprise tech stacks, cloud platforms, ML tools, job roles, skills, and salary insights. It aims to provide a comprehensive view of how organizations leverage data science and operationalize machine learning in 2022.

## Key Objectives
- **AI Adoption**: Assess the state of Machine Learning adoption in enterprises.
- **Tech Stack**: Identify popular tools, frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and languages (e.g., Python, SQL, R).
- **Cloud Platforms**: Evaluate usage of AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for ML operations.
- **Transfer Learning**: Examine its impact in business environments.
- **AI Careers**: Highlight top job roles, required skills, team sizes, and education levels.
- **Salary Trends**: Provide insights into compensation across roles, industries, and regions.

## Key Findings
- **ML Adoption**: 32.8% of organizations have ML models in production, while 21.7% haven’t started exploring AI.
- **Industry Leaders**: Internet-based services, insurance, and tech companies lead in AI adoption.
- **Company Size**: Larger firms (1,000+ employees) outpace smaller ones in AI implementation.
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - **Languages**: Python (79.9%), SQL, and R (21.2%) dominate.
  - **Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras are top choices.
  - **Cloud**: 45% use cloud platforms, with AWS and GCP leading.
- **Transfer Learning**: Widely used in computer vision, less so in NLP.
- **Hardware**: Only 31% use specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs) for ML training.
- **Jobs**: Data Scientists (21%) and Data Analysts (16.6%) are the most common roles.
- **Skills**: Python, SQL, and cloud expertise are critical.
- **Education**: 43.5% hold Master’s degrees.
- **Salaries**: Data Architects earn the highest median ($65K), followed by Managers ($55K).
